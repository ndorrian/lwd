# What is the project?

The motivation of our Erasmus + project 'Living with Diversity' was to bring together a group of French and British/Irish students from a range of different religious and ethnic backgrounds and encourage them to explore their cultural differences and similarities whilst investigating the impact of diversity on their school lives. This is alongside the language learning value of the exchanges. We wanted to encourage our students to see the value in diversity and how it can enrich our culture as individuals an as a school/society. As an integrated school, we at Strangford College already have an ethos of inclusion and promote a spirit of acceptance and tolerance for all regardless of religion, race or creed. Our link school College Raymond Poincare is a multicultural school and the idea of inclusion and integration is very much at the core of their teaching and learning. The vast majority of their school intake is from a Muslim background with many students who have French as a second language. Both our schools have students who are from socially deprived backgrounds and we wanted this trip to be available to all students. I was confident that this partner school would be a perfect fit for my students and my school and that the benefits of the funding would help us to promote the very celebration of diversity and humanity.

There were 40 students in total, 20 from each school ranging from the age of 13-15. We had 5 staff in total as 2 of our students have additional medical needs and we required a fulltime first aider with us at all times.

Throughout the project we encouraged the students to explore their cultural heritage and teach each other about diversity. We stayed on site as part of a residential exchange both in Northern Ireland and in Paris so the students could forge solid and fast friendships. The aim of exploring diversity was a focus in both schools and outside of school on day trips. The project allowed the students to have practical cookery lessons and learn recipes from each other's countries. As our link school has many students who originate from other countries outside of France (such as Algeria), this will be an opportunity to celebrate the rich culture of our varied backgrounds. there was a party on the last night in Paris and many of the parents brought dishes from their home countries for us to sample. The students naturally improved their language speaking skills and visited historical monuments in each other's countries.

# Northern Ireland

In March, 20 French students arrived for a week long stay in Ganaway where they explored the theme of Living with Diversity with their Strangford counterparts. They learnt about the political conflict in NI and the impact it has had on both sides of the community and with thanks to our friends in the PSNI, everyone learnt a lot about conflict resolution and peaceful transformation and the on-going importance of Integration.

The students began their stay with some activities at Ganaway, including high ropes, team building activities, archery, zip wires and many more. The students were in mixed groups and this was a great way to get to know each other. Following this the students enjoyed dinner together and then participated in some more team activities before having free time with each other.

The students also visited the Ulster Folk museum where the students had fun with Northern Irish colloquial phrases before exploring the history of Ulster and having the opportunity to learn about felt making, weaving and the art of pottery in Ireland.

The next stop was a cinema trip allowing the students the opportunity to strengthen their friendships.

A very thought provoking and insightful day was spent in Belfast. The students visited the Peace walls and the murals and explored peaceful resolutions to conflict and discussed the impact of diversity in our countries and society as a whole. They also visited a police station in a key interface area to learn about the role of the PSNI and the combat unit during the peak of the

political violence and their ongoing conflict transformation work in their community. This is entirely fitting with the theme of 'Living with Diversity' and the concept of inclusion.

The French students joined their Strangford College counterparts in school for a carousel of lessons. The students enjoyed a cookery lesson, making traditional Irish wheaten bread, an art workshop where they made a beautiful piece to take come and a music lesson where they learnt about Irish folklore and music and composed a short Irish jig. This was hard evidence of the mutual learning involved and the celebration of cultural heritage.

# Paris

In October 2019 the second half of the exchange took place in Paris. After a joyful reunion we enjoyed a day exploring the sights of Paris, stopping at each to allow the French students to teach us about the monuments and we also explored some of the UNCRC articles.

Another wonderful day was spent at Versaille Palace and as we explored the Palace we learnt about the impact of the French Revolution on the country and the on-going political issues that are thrashed out there and brought to the Palace gates.

As in Northern Ireland a day was spent in school at le Collège Raymond Poincaré. The students enjoyed a PE lesson, a science lesson and an Art workshop. It was a wonderful day and it allowed the Strangford College students to experience in an authentic way how Collège Raymond Poincaré caters for the cultural and religious needs of their students.

The French students and their families hosted a party for the Irish students and brought traditional dishes from their home countries again allowing the Strangford College students to appreciate the diverse cultures represented in their partner school.
